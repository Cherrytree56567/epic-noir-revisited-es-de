# Epic Noir (Revisited) (ES-DE Version)
This is port of the Epic Noir theme by [c64-dev & Chicuelo](https://github.com/c64-dev) for the version of EmulationStation used in [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/) v2.x

**All artwork and layouts were designed and created by c64-dev & Chicuelo.  I simply made changes to the XML to make the theme compatible with ES-DE. The original version of the theme can be found [here](https://github.com/c64-dev/es-theme-epicnoir)**

## Changes Made
- Redesigned the design/layout of system and gamelist views
- Removed all Retropie specific elements to make the theme compatible with ES-DE v2.x
- Updated system image names to match the standard used by ES-DE
- Added a 16:10 Layout Variant
- Add support for ES-DE capabilities such as badges and aspect ratio switching
